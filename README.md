# FinQuery — Natural Language to Pandas Financial Assistant

FinQuery is a **local, secure, and intelligent data analysis tool** that converts natural language (NL) financial queries into **safe Pandas (Python Data Analysis Library) operations**.  
It enables users to ask questions about bank or expense data in plain language and receive accurate tables, charts, and insights instantly.

## 🚀 Project Goal
To build a sandboxed system that:
- Understands financial questions in natural language (NL)
- Converts them into validated Python/Pandas code
- Executes them securely in a restricted environment
- Displays results visually using tables and charts
- Works offline with **no paid API (Application Programming Interface)** required

## 🧠 Key Features
- **Natural Language Querying** (e.g., *"Show my total spend in March"*)
- **Safe Code Generation** using AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) validation
- **Sandboxed Execution** to prevent harmful code execution
- **Financial Insights** using charts and structured data
- **Store and Reuse Queries**
- **Streamlit UI (User Interface)** for interactive usage
